## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Unity 2020.1

## Integrations
TAT has some character setup integrations with:
* RootMotion's FinalIK
* DigitalOpus' Mesh Baker
* Tore Knabe's Realistic Eye Movement
If you have those plugins installed you can use the Avatar Setup tool to automatically build your character prefab with those tools attached.
  
## Setup
Use Unity's Package Manager to install this from the URL or local clone repository. If you have one of the plugins mentioned in Integrations, you can import the integration packages from the Editor/Integrations Packages folder. More to come...
